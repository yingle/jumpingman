A little funny game developed in C++. Basic function implemented. Other functions will be added.

to run:
        cd build-jumpingman-Desktop_Qt_5_6_0_GCC_64bit-Debug
        ./jumpingman
        
to make, the Qt library is needed (v. 5.6) and on appropriate architecture:
        cd build-jumpingman-Desktop_Qt_5_6_0_GCC_64bit-Debug
        make
        ./jumpingman
